# Serverless Data Pipeline Framework

An open-source framework for building scalable, serverless data pipelines in the cloud. This project demonstrates best practices for data engineering using AWS serverless services (Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, EventBridge). It supports real-time and batch data processing workflows.

## Features
- Modular ETL pipeline with ingestion, transformation, and aggregation stages
- Infrastructure-as-Code with CloudFormation and Terraform
- Automated CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Sample datasets and use cases for real-time analytics and batch processing
